    Behold the Father's heart
    The mystery He lavishes on us
    As deep cries out to deep
    Oh, how desperately He wants us
    
    The things of earth stand next to Him
    Like a candle to the sun
    Unfailing Father
    What compares to His great love
    
    Behold His holy Son
    The Lion and the Lamb given to us
    The Word became a man
    That my soul should know its Saviour
    
    Forsaken for the sake of all mankind
    Salvation is in His blood
    Jesus Messiah
    The righteous died for love
    
    It wasn't over
    For He is the risen One
    
    Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
    Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
    How great Your love is
    How great Your love is
    
    Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
    Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
    How great Your love is
    How great Your love is
    
    Then sings my soul
    
    Behold I have a friend
    The Spirit breathing holy fire within
    My ever present help
    Speaking truth when I can't find it
    
    Light up this broken heart and light my way
    'til my time on earth is do-one
    Oh, Holy Spirit
    Breathe in me like kingdom come
    
    Oh, Holy Spirit
    Let Your work in me be done
    
    Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
    Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
    How great Your love is
    How great Your love is
    
    Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
    Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
    How great Your love is
    How great Your love is
    
    Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
    Then sings my sou-ou-ouu-ou-oul
    How great Your love is
    How great Your love is
    
    Then sings my soul my God
    He who was and is to come
    Prepare the way
    Until the work on earth is done
    
    Watch as the clouds He rides swing low
    Lift up the sound
    As He makes our praise His throne
    Behold the Lord our God will lead us home

<pre style="font-size: 16px;" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
When You found me
my whole world changed
I'm redeemed by Your life
let the earth sing
You are freedom
turn my darkness to light

You welcome me in
with open arms
into unending light

I'm not ashamed of the gospel Lord
Your power Your love
You saved my soul
now I'm alive in You
I live in the risen Son
